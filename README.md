# ehux_assembly_stats
Plots of contig length distribution, N50 and GC percentage for assemblies of 15 *Emiliania huxleyi* strains, initially assembled using [Eukphonium](https://github.com/AlexanderLabWHOI/EUKphonium).
Predicted genome sizes were determined using [Genomescope](https://github.com/schatzlab/genomescope).
